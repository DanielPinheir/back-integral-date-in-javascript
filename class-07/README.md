# Extra exercise ðŸŒŸ

## Is the promotion still valid?

A certain promotion is valid for only 30 calendar days. Create a function that takes two arguments:

1. The start Date() of the promotion
2. The Date() on which the customer requested to use this promotion

Your function should return `true` if the user is authorized to take advantage of the promotion, and `false` otherwise.
