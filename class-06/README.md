## Is the promotion valid?

A certain promotion is valid for only 24 hours. Create a function that takes two arguments:

1. The promotion start Date()
2. The Date() on which the customer requested to use this promotion

Your function should return `true` if the user is authorized to take advantage of the promotion, and `false` otherwise.
